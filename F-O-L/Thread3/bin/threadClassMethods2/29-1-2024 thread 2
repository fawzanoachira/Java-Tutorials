thread class methods 2
----------------------

Daemon thread
-------------

daemon threads are threads which executes under the background of an another thread.
daemon threads are used to provide service for an another thread.
eg: garbage collector, finalizer, signal dispatchers

cases:-
	1. had to set a thread daemon, we have to done it before starting the thread.
	2. can't set main thread as daemon.
	3. life of daemon thread depends on another thread
	4. daemon thread can inherits properties from its parent thread.
	
jvm's role on daemon thread
---------------------------

jvm is not depended on daemon threads. if any other thread active jvm will not shutdown any threads. but if there is a daemon thread alive after any other threads daemon thread forcefully 
shutdown any daemon thread is active.


priorities on thread

jvm provides priorities to each thread and according to this jvm allocate processer for execution.
priorities range will be 10 -> 1

1 --> MIN_PRIORITY
5 --> NORM_PRIORITY
10 --> MAX_PRIORITY
