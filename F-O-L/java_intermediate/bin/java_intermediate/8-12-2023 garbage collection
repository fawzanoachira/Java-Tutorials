garbage collection

remove unwanted objects to free memory for effiecient memory utilization. garbage are called unreferenced objects. apart from c or c++
jvm automatically removes objects.

finalize method is a method which invoke just before garbage objects are collected.

this method is used to clean up processing.

finalize method is always done by jvm automatically. but if we wanted to do some logic brfore garbage collection,

	inherit finalize method from object class and edit logic in the method.
	use System.gc() to invoke finalize method.

syntax:- 
	

gc() method

used to invoke the garbage collector to perform clean up processing.

in order to work Method overriding, there should be inheritance in program.
