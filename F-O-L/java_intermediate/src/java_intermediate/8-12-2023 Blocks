Blocks in Java

Blocks are set of statements used to initialize data members(global variables) of the class.

Blocks are different types:-

1. Static Block
		Like, static{
				stmnts;
			  }
			  
		1. static blocks executes when class is loaded by class loader. it meant to be initialize the static members of the class.
		2. static blocks execute once in life cycle of any program. another property is that it executes before main method.
		3. are also called static initialization block.
		4. static block gets executed only once per entire program execution
		
2. Non Static Block(Instance Block)
		Like, {
				stmnts;
			  }
		1. instance block will execute whenever object is created
		2. if there are more than 1 instance blocks it will execute in the sequence order of it written.
		3. are also called non static / instance initialization block.
		4. this block get executed whenever objects are created.
