HashSet
----------

properties:-
	1. no index
	2. do not follow insertion order.
	3. duplicate values can't be add.
	4. null value can be added
	5. multiple null values not allowed.
	6. heterogeneous values can be added.
	7. underlying data structure is hash table.
	
	default capacity of hashset is 16.
	.75 is the default value of load factor.
	newcapacity=currentcapacity*2
	
	in here new object will create when 75% of current capacity fills rather than full
	
when we create hashset, first objects which are added will be converted to hashmap. hashmap is a key value pair
and all the objects are stored in the key section of hashmap. when we call the hashset, the sored objects in hashmap will be converted
to hashtable by some conversion technique, and that's where the values are retrieving. that's why there is no insertion order is not preserved.

for conversion,
	key%capacity equation used and we get the value and it is the index and that index is on hashtable.
	
hashset has 5 constructors.
	will be discuss 4 constructors.
	
	1. zero argument
	2. initial capacity
	3. initial capacity, load factor
	4. collection c, convert one collection to another.
	
	default capacity will be 16 and load factor will be 0.75.
