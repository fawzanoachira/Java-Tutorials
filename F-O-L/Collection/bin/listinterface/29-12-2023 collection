Collection

COLLECTION 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
• Collection is nothing but a group of objects repesents as single unit.
• It's main purpose is to store huge amount of data. 
• It provides multiple API(methods) to store and manipulate data
• Collection is the root interface of CollectionFramework. 
• Collection interface is extended by 3 different interfaces
- collection has a super interface called iterable.

 1.List<Interface> 
 2.Set<Interface> 
 3.Queue<Interface> 
• Learning about collection means learning about classes and its 
  characteristics. 
• Different classes of collection are : 
 1.ArrayList 
 2.LinkedList 
 3.Vector 
• implements List Interface 
 4.PriorityQueue 
 5.LinkedList 
• implements Queue interface
6.Treeset
7.Hashset
8.LinkedHashSet
• implements SetInterface



Difference b/w list and array

array					list
------------------------------
homogeneous data		homo/heterogeneous data
fixed size				growable
in built method			in built method
array is a class		list is a interface

list interface
---------------

properties

1. list has index
2. list can store duplicate values
3. list can store multiple mull values
4. list preserves insertion order

implementation class
--------------------

1. ArrayList
2. vector
3. LinkedList


characteristics to study for every class - 
• homogeneous or hetrogeneous
• Null object is possible or not
• duplicates allowed or not
• insertion order is preserve or not
• data structure
