Interface

Interface is a java type definition declared by using interface similar to a class
or interface is medium btw two systems where one system is the client and other is the object with services.
eg: person switch(interface)fan

interface is a type where methods are by default abstract and public. variables are by default static and final. 

objects cannot be created for interface.

can create reference variable of interface.
Like, interfacename referencevariablename; 

class can inherit the properties of an interface only by using implements keyword.

interface where the properties are inherited is called super interface.
properties inherited class is called implemented class.

from one interface to another interface in order to do inherit use extends keyword.

in interface class cannot be inherited, bcos class contains concrete methods.

If class implements an Interface then the Implementation class must override all the abstract methods present in super Interface else the class must be declared as abstract class
-An interface cannot implements another interface.
-An interface should only extends another interface.
-An interface can NEVER inherit or extends from a class not even from Object class
-A class can implements any number of interfaces.
-A class can extends ONLY one Superclass but it can implements any number of interfaces.
-A class can extends and implements at the same time.
