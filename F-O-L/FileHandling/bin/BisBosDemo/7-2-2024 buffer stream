BufferedOutputStream
--------------------

The buffered output stream class of the java.io package is used with other output streams to write the data(in bytes) more efficiently

Working of Buffered Output stream
---------------------------------

The BufferedOutputStream maintains an internal buffer of 8192 bytes

During the write operation the bytes are written to the internal buffer instead of the disk. Once the buffer is filled or the stream is 
closed the whole buffer is written to the disk.
Hence the number of communication to the disk is reduced this is why writing bytes is faster using buffered output stream

It helps us to work with primitive datatypes
it is a class present in java.io package
