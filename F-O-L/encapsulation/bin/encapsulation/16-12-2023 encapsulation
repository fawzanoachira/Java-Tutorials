Encapsulation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• The process of wrapping the data members(Global variables) and function
members(methods) into a single unit(class) is called as
Encapsulation.


Examples of Encapsulation: 
--------------------------- 
1. protecting bank details from an invalid user to access is an example
of encapsulation.
2. keeping a password for mobile to protect data is an example of
encapsulation.
3. protecting an online documents by keeping pasword is an example of
encapsulation.
4. securing house by keeping lock is an example of encapsulation.

• The main purpose of encapsulation is to achieve security of data 

• Declaring data members as private and grant the access through getter 
  and setter methods is called encapsulation

Fully Encapsulated class 
--------------------------- 
• if all data members of a class are private and there is separate
methods to access those data, such class is called as Fully
Encapsulated class.
class A
{
 private int i; 
 private float f; 
 private String s; 
 //methods to access them//
} 

Partially Encapsulated class 
------------------------------- 
• if any data members of a class is non private, such class is called
as Partially Encapsulated class.
class A
{
 private String name; 
 public int age; 
 }
 
No Encapsulated class /Un encapsulated class
--------------------------------------------
• if none of data members of a class is private, such class is called 
as No Encapsulated class. 
 class A 
 { 
 public String name; 
 public int age; 
 } 
 
 
Advantages Of Encapsulated class : 
----------------------------------- 
• Securing the data 
• We can make our class as write only by writing only setter method.
• We can make our class as read only by defining only getter method.


Dis-advantages Of Encapsulated class : 
-------------------------------------- 
• length of the code increases.
