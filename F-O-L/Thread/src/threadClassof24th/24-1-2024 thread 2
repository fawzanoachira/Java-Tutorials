Thread 2
---------

Race condition
-------------
if multiple thread is trying is to access same object at the same time race condition occurs.
race condition always leads to inconsistent data.

how to avoid race condition
1. thread synchronization
--------------------------------
it is the process of executing threads in the sequential order where one thread will execute only after the other thread finish execution

2 ways:-
	1. synchronized methods
		are the methods which use synchronized keyword on methods.
	2. synchronized blocks
		are used with synchronized block
	3. static synchronized
		from above two methods race condition does not occur, because using those methods threads will be locked and executed sequentially.
		but that is for only one object. if we create multiple objects race condition will occur between those objects.
		thats where static synchronized used. by implementing this the particular class will be locked until the current thread executed.
