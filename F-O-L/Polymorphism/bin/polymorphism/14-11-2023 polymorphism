Polymorphism

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 it is a greek word. 
 poly means many and morphism means forms. 


• One entity showing different behaviors at different places is called Polymorphism


Method BINDING
-----------------------------Associating or Mapping method caller with methhod implementation

• Polymorphism is of two types
1. Compile time Polymorphism
2. Runtime Polymorphism

Compile Time Polymorphism 

• Binding the method declaration to method definition by the compiler at the compile 
   time based on the arguments is called as compile time Polymorphism.

• Since the binding is done before the execution it is called as early binding.


• Once the binding is done it cannot be changed at the Runtime and hence it is also 
  called as Static Binding

• Method Overloading and Constructor overloading is the best example for Compile time Polymorphism


• All static and final methods will get binded during compile time 
  i.e,during compilation only method will come to know what is its implementation
  
Run Time PolyMorphism

• Binding the method declaration to method definition by the JVM at the run time based on 
  the objects is called as run time Polymorphism

• Once the binding is done it can be changed at the Runtime and hence it is also called 
  as dynamic Binding.

• Since  the binding is done during execution it is called as late binding

• Method Overriding is the best example for Run time Polymorphism
• Abstract methods will get binded during run time
  i.e, Non static and abstarct method can beoverridden.


• Golden java rule 
• ***** Using an upcasted reference if you call an overriden method then you always get 
  the implementation of subclass.
