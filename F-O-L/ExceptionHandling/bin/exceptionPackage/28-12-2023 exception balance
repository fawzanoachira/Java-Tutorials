Exception cases
--------------
	
	-we cant declare try block only
	-try with multiple catches possible
	-but if super class is catched first multiple catch is not possible.
	-which means first sub class exception then last super class exception.
	-as we know that, object class is the super most class, but we can't store exception in object clss
		like, catch(Object e) cannot possible.
	-we can use Throwable class to handle exception.
	-can't use Exception class after Throwable class is handled exception.
	-exception must be handled through only the Throwable or it's subclasses.
	
	-try and finally can be work without error even there is no catch block.
	-two finally cannot be possible.
