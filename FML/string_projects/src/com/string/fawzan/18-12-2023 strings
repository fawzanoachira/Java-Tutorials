String Class
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• String value is a group of characters which is written in the double quotes.
• We can access the characters or perform any operations on the string only by 
  using the methods of String class.
• Internally String value is stored as a character Array by the JVM.
  String str = “hello” ‘h’ ‘e’ ‘l’ ‘l’ ‘o’
                        0   1   2   3   4
• In java string is an -
1. object
2. datatype
3. class
4. group of characters

Methods of String 

•length() : It returns the count of number of characters present in the given String.

•charAt(index) : It returns the character at the given index from the given String.

•indexOf(char) : It returns the index of the given character from the given String. It returns -ve value if the character do not exist.

•indexOf(char,startIndex) : It returns the index of the given character from the given String by starting the search from the given startIndex. 

•equals(string) : It compares characters of given two strings and returns true if they are exactly same else it returns false. 

•equalsIgnoreCase(string) : It compares characters of given two strings by igiorning the case and returns true if they are exactly same else it returns false.

•substring(start, no.of chras) : It creates a String from the given start index with  given no. of characters and returns the String.

.toUpperCase():String 
• Converts string into uppercase 
.toLowerCase():String 
• Converts string into lowercase 
.startsWith(string):boolean 
• check whether string is starting with given string or not 
endsWith(string):boolean 
• check whether string is ending with given string or not 
contains(String):boolean 
• checks whether string is present in given string or not 
isEmpty():boolean 
• checks whether string is empty or not 


•NOTE
•length and length()
•length -> variable used in array
•length() -> method of String
String value is group of chars written within double quotes
* In java String is a class which is used to store group of chars the String object.
* String class is immediate sub-class of Object class
* String class implements Serializable, Comparable<String>, CharSequence interfaces
* String class is final and it cannot be inherited.
* hashCode() of Object class is overriden in String class which returns an integer value that is 
generated based on unicode values of every character present in given String

* toString() of Object class is overriden in String class
which returns the string value present in given string
object.

* equals() of Object class is overriden in String class
which compares characters present in given 2 strings
and returns true if they are same else returns false
