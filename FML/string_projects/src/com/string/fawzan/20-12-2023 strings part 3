intern();

In Java, the intern() method is a method of the String class, and it is used to put the string into the pool of strings, where the Java runtime system 
keeps a pool of strings for reusability. When the intern() method is called on a string, if the pool already contains a string equal to this String 
object as determined by the equals(Object) method, then the string from the pool is returned. Otherwise, this String object is added to the pool, 
and a reference to this String object is returned.


StringBuilder() balance
--------------------------

capacity() method returns default size, which is 16, if we put like this StringBuilder s = new StringBuilder();.
But if we put StringBuilder s = new StringBuilder("hello);, default size will be 16+5 = 21.

StringBulder() have 3 different constructors.
