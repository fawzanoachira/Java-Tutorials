Type casting
--------------------------------------------------------------
• Converting one Type to another Type is called is TypeCasting.
• Converting one Primitive data type value to another Primitive data type value is called as Primitive Casting.
• TypeCasting is of 2 types
	Primitive Casting
	Derived Casting
• Primitive Casting is of 2 types
	• Widening
	• Narrowing
• Derived Casting is of 2 types
	• up-casting
	• down-casting
	
Widening Converting lower data type value to Higher Data type value
	Widening is done implicitly by the compiler.
	
Narrowing: Converting higher data type value to lower Data type value. 
	Narrowing should be done explicitly by the programmer by writting

• casting statement.
