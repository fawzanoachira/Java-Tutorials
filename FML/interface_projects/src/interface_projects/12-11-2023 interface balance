Interface balance

-after jdk 8 interface can use concrete methods inside.
-if a method in the interface which not want to over-rided declare it as static
-default keyword cannot be used in classes.
-if a method want in the interface which want to over-rided declare it as default.
-default methods of interface can be accessed by using Object of its implementation class ONLY.
-static methods of interface can be accessed by using interface name with dot(.) operator.
-If two interfaces contains static methods with the same name and same arguments then we differentiate them with help of Interface Name.
-If two interfaces contains default methods with the same name and same arguments then, it should be overridden in the implementation class
	Like, 	@Override
			public void test() {
				InterfaceJdk.super.test();
				Sample1.super.test();
			}
