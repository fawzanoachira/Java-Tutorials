Object Class

object class is a super most class in java, which is pre-defined.

every class we create we can inherit the properties of object class directly or indirectly.


Why multiple inheritance is not possible in java? Diamond problem

1. as we know, every class inherit the properties of object class(oc).

   if there are two class a,b and a third class c, which is inheriting properties from a and b. when at the compile time compiler get confused, because where should he take the path
   of oc from a or b. this makes ambiguity in compiler.
   
2. to call multiple constructors of multiple super class, we need to write multiple super statements in sub class. it is not supported in java

3. if there are same method with same name in both super class, compiler confuse to call which method. this makes ambiguity.
