Relations
-------------

There are two relations
	1. Is A relation
	2. Has a relation
	
Is a relation is also inheritance.

Has a relation:
	if an object have to perform a task, but it should have some properties from other class or object, there should have a relation.
	it's called has a relation
	Like, car is a vehicle.
		  car has a engine.
		  
the class where the property is inherited is called base/super/parent class.
the class where the property is acquired is called sub/derived/child class.

for acquiring inheritance java uses extends keyword.

if we create object of parent class in main function, we only access the properties of parent class only.
Like, 

/////////////////////////////////////////////
	class Sample{
	void test1() {
		System.out.println("hiiiiiiiiiii");
	}
}

public class Relations extends Sample {
	
	void test() {
		System.out.println("sdbfdsbdshb");
	}
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Sample ob = new Sample();
		ob.test1(); 
	}	
//////////////////////////////////////////////

some cases
----------

case 1: if we declare a class as final, we can't inherit that class.
