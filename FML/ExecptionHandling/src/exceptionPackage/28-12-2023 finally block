finally block
-------------

finally block is executed irrespective of occurance of exceptions.
* finally block should be written after the catch block.

Exception are of 2 types
	1. Checked exception
	2. Unchecked exception

Unchecked exceptions	
* Exceptions which are not checked by the compiler at the compile time are called as unchecked exceptions.
* RuntimeException and all of its Subclasses are Unchecked exceptions.

Checked Exceptions
* Except RuntimeException and its Subclasses all other exceptions are checked exceptions.

Exception propagation:
Passing the exception object from called method to calling method is
known as Exception propagation. 
* Unchecked exceptions will be implicitly propagated by the JVM.

throws keyword
* throws keyword is used to propagate checked exceptions explicitly by the programmer.
