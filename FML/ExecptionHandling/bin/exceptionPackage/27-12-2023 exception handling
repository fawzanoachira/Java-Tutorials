Errors
-------
There are differernt types of error

	1. runtime error
	2. compile time error
		eg. syntax error
if error occurs, whole pgm will not work.

Exception Handling:-
--------------------------------------
* Exception is an unexpected event which occurs at Runtime due to unexpected operation performed by a single line of code

* Exception handling is writing code which will recover the program from the exception and continue the execution.

* Error is an unexpected event which occurs at Runtime due to hardware or software failure of the system.

* Error is an interruption occur during when program is executed.

Reason For the exception:-
--------------------------------------

* When ever there is an exception JVM will create an Object of corresponding exception class.

* JVM will pass the exception object to the method which created the exception by using throw keyword.

* If the method is not able to handle the exception object, then JVM will terminate the method's execution.

* If no methods are handling the exception object then JVM will call Default Exception Handler which will handle the exception Object.
* Default exception handler will handle the exception and prints
	-name of the exception
	-reason for the exception
	-compile stack trace
	
if a programmer going to handle exception, he can do it with try catch.
	
try-catch block
-----------------
	try
	{
	risky lines of code
	}
	catch(ExceptionClass ref)
	{
	alternate code
	}	
try with multiple catch blocks
	Exception e = new ArithmeticException();
	Exception e2 = new ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException();
	Exception e3 = new StringIndexOutOfBoundsException();
	Exception e4 = new ClassCastException();
	Exception e5 = new NullPointerException();
	Exception e6 = new NumberFormatException();
	
	
finally block
* finally block is executed irrespective of occurance of exceptions.
* finally block should be written after the catch block.

Exception are of 2 types
	1. Checked exception
	2. Unchecked exception
	
* Exceptions which are not checked by the compiler at the compile time are called as unchecked exceptions.
* Leaving RuntimeException and its Subclasses all other exceptions are checked exceptions.
* RuntimeException and all of its Subclasses are Unchecked exceptions.
