Wrapper classes :
---------------------------------------------
• In order to represent primitive datatype as an object we use wrapper classes!
• For every primitive data type, there is a corresponding wrapper class available in java.
• Since java is 100% object oriented, we have to represent everything as object
• Therefore to represent primitive datatype as object we use wrapper classes.

primitive datatype				wrapper class
---------------------------------------------
byte							Byte
boolean							Boolean
char							Character
short							Short
float							Float
int								Integer
double							Double
long							Long

• All wrapper classes are final classes.
• All wrapper classes are present in java.lang package.


Boxing and unboxing
-------------------
Coverting primitive datatype to wrapper class/object type is known as boxing. vice versa is known as unboxing.
boxing can be done by using valueOf() method.
