there is 2 interfaces in treeset
	1. comparable
	2. comparator
	
in treeset internally comparable interface is inheriting and sorting is done by this interface.

if we want to do customized sorting or external sorting we use comparator interface.

we can use comparable interface for this purpose. but that interface is also done internally. 



comparable interface					comparator interface
1.it is present java.lang package		1.it is present in java.util package

2.it is not mandatory to import			2.it is mandatory to import
	comparable interface

3. Comparable interface contains 
	only one abstract method 
	compareTo(Object o)					3.it contains two abstract methods 
											1.compare(Object o, Object 01), equals(Obj o)

4.comparable interface is used 
	to perform default natural 
	sorting and customized sorting

 										4. it is only used for customized sorting
 										
 										
 									
How to use Comparable interface
--> create a class that implements comparable interface
-->overrride all the abstract methods present in comparable interface
-->change the defnition according to users specification
-->create an object of implementation class


for comparison
	1. if values are primitive type like int , double etc. we can compare those by using if else statements.
	2. if values are in wrapper class we can compare it by using the method compareTo().
